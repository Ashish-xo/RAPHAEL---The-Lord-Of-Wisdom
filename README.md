# Raphael, Lord of Wisdom

A **client-side** V Rising UI that turns the chat commands of popular **server-side** mods into buttons, forms, and on-screen overlays. Each mod's tabs appear only when that mod is detected on your server — so it works whether your server runs one, several, or none.

**Works with:** Bloodcraft · Beelzebub · Uriel · Faust · KindredCommands · KindredLogistics — plus a standalone tabbed chat window that works on **any** server.

> 🟣 **Formerly BloodCraftHub** — same mod, renamed. Switching over? See **[Migrating from BloodCraftHub](#migrating-from-bloodcrafthub)** and **don't run both at once.**
>
> ⚠️ **Pre-1.0 beta.** It's daily-driven on a live server, but you may hit rough edges. The fastest way to get a fix is the **[Shadow Realm Discord](https://discord.gg/usC9QgBrXK)**.

## What you get

- **One panel for your server's mods** — left-rail tab groups for Bloodcraft, Kindred, Beelzebub, Uriel, and Faust; each shows only when detected.
- **Commands as forms** — player pickers, dropdowns, and number fields instead of typing `.lvl set <Player> <Level>` into chat.
- **Live HUD overlays** — XP, familiar, weapon/blood, professions, quests, shift-spell cooldown, and more. Each is draggable, resizable, and individually toggleable.
- **Standalone chat window** — tabbed per-channel chat (Global / Local / Clan / Whispers / System), whisper anyone online, custom colors. Needs no server mods.
- **Admin tooling** — surfaced wherever the backing mod provides it: Kindred admin, Beelzebub ability shaping, Faust server analytics, Uriel sharing/spawning.

<summary><b>Full feature list</b></summary>

- **Floating Raphael + OV buttons** (top-right) — open the panel; OV is a master overlay show/hide (with optional timed auto-reappear and launcher hiding).
- **Tab groups** (each appears only when its server mod is detected):
  - **Bloodcraft** — Familiars, Boxes, V-Bloods, All Familiars, Class, Weapon Expertise, Blood Legacy, Unarmed + Shift, Prestige, Levels, Daily Quests, Admin.
  - **Kindred** — Logistics (+ admin), Commands, Admin: Players / Server / World.
  - **Beelzebub** — Bestiary, Loadout (universal + per-weapon + per-form ability sets), Hotkeys, Transforms, Settings, admin Config / Players.
  - **Faust** — Castle Info, Open/All Plots, Decay Watch, Castle Resources, Player Info, Clans, Player Positions, Server Stats, **Boss Status**, **Leaderboards**, **World Map**, admin Control / Oversight.
  - **Settings & Help** — Quick Start, Mod Help, Game Guide, Settings, About.
- **Secondary overlays** (toggle from the footer) — XP, Familiar, Familiar Browser, Daily Quest, Professions, Shift Spell, a Combined info overlay, Quick Actions, a Familiar Quick Spawn overlay, and a Faust Boss Tracker. Each is independently draggable/resizable with its own transparency; visibility persists across sessions.
- **Freeze actions while the UI is open** (opt-in) — stop moving/attacking/casting and block menu hotkeys while you click around the panel.
- **"Last server response" panel** — replies to read-data commands (`.wep get`, `.class l`, …) show in-UI, not just in chat.
- **Live data** via Bloodcraft's signed broadcast protocol, with chat-regex fallback for replies it doesn't cover.
- **Quality of life** — hover tooltips on every control, auto-resizing panel, scrollable tabs + left rail, a two-zone color theme, a 50–400% text-size slider, and opt-in keyboard hotkeys.

## Install

Client-side only — install on the **player's** V Rising client, not the server.

**Mod manager (recommended):** in Thunderstore Mod Manager or r2modman, open your V Rising profile → search **Raphael** → Install. Make sure **BepInExPack_V_Rising** is in the same profile, then launch from the manager.

**Manual:** install BepInEx for V Rising, drop `Raphael.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`, launch.

On your first connect to a modded server, a floating **Raphael** button appears top-right. Hover any control to see what it does (the description shows in the footer). Non-admin commands work for everyone; admin tabs need permissions.

## ⚠️ Before you install

<details>
<summary><b>Running Eclipse? (compatibility needs re-testing)</b></summary>

Historically, Raphael + [Eclipse](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/zfolmt/Eclipse/) crashed the client on load (the fault is in Eclipse's HUD code, not Raphael). When Raphael detects Eclipse it stands down from its own passive Bloodcraft layer to avoid the crash: **Eclipse** drives the live HUD, while Raphael keeps its command buttons and chat window. Eclipse has since updated and this hasn't been re-verified — **disable Eclipse while running Raphael to be safe.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Raphael looks empty on a Bloodcraft server?</b></summary>

Raphael's live HUD and Bloodcraft tabs are driven by Bloodcraft's broadcast, which only runs when the server enables at least one of: **Leveling**, **Legacy**, **Expertise**, **Class**, or **Familiar** systems. A Quests-only / Professions-only server won't engage it — click the **Bloodcraft** header for an in-panel diagnostic with a one-click **Force-enable tabs** button (chat commands still work; live overlays stay empty until the server broadcasts).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Controller / gamepad</b></summary>

There are known edge cases when V Rising's controller input meets the Raphael UI (e.g. a face button re-opening the panel after a waypoint teleport). A first-pass fix is in; more testing is ongoing. If something opens/closes/focuses on the wrong button, please report it on Discord with repro steps.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Rolling back a version</b></summary>

- **Mod manager:** select Raphael → version dropdown → pick an earlier build (quit the game first).
- **Crash on load after an update:** close the game and delete `BepInEx/interop` and `BepInEx/cache` in your profile — they rebuild on next launch.

</details>

## Migrating from BloodCraftHub

Raphael **replaces** BloodCraftHub — don't run both. They have separate plugin IDs, so installing Raphael without removing BloodCraftHub loads **both** (duplicate buttons, panels, overlays).

1. In your mod manager, **uninstall or disable BloodCraftHub** (`kdpen/BloodCraftHub`).
2. **Install Raphael** (`kdpen/Raphael`).
3. **Fully quit and relaunch V Rising.**

Settings don't transfer — Raphael writes a new config, so overlay positions, colors, and hotkeys start at defaults (your old `kdpen.BloodCraftHub.cfg` is left untouched in case you roll back).

<details>
<summary><b>Compatibility (tested versions)</b></summary>

| Mod | Tested | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **BepInExPack_V_Rising** | 1.733.2 | Loader (hard dependency) |
| **Bloodcraft** (server) | v1.13.21 | Primary integration |
| **KindredCommands** (server) | v2.5.8 | Admin/player commands → Kindred |
| **KindredLogistics** (server) | v1.6.0 | Logistics toggles → Kindred |
| **Beelzebub** (server, optional) | API 22 | Abilities / transforms → Beelzebub |
| **Faust** (server, optional) | 0.16.x (API 18) | Server investigation & analytics → Faust |
| **Uriel** (server, optional) | v0.19.0 | Storage / prisons / stairs / spawning → Uriel |
| **Eclipse** (client) | v1.3.13 | ⚠ Compatibility needs re-testing — disable while running Raphael |

Newer Bloodcraft builds generally still work — the chat-command grammar is stable. If a tab does nothing on click, the server likely renamed a command.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Known issues</b></summary>

- **Eclipse** compatibility needs re-testing (see above) — disable it to be safe.
- **Controller** edge cases under investigation (see above).
- **Conservative per-system detection** — Raphael may show Bloodcraft tabs for systems the server has disabled (they'll just be empty); per-system hiding is planned.
- **Limited autocomplete / pagination** — the name cache fills from chat but forms don't yet show a dropdown; only `.clan list` has prev/next widgets so far.
